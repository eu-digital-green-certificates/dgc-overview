## Architectural Overview

![Architectural Overview](./images/OverviewDGC.png)

## Supported Certificate Types

The current verifier and wallet apps are supporting for verification and storing: 
- [x] DCC 
- [x] Smart Health Cards (https://smarthealth.cards/en/)
- [x] Verifiable Credentials (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/, JWT Encoding)
- [ ] ICAO
- [ ] DIVOC

Other formats are prepared but not yet implemented. For establishing the trustlist, the verifier service shares a list of trusted issuer links, downloaded from the gateway [Verifier Service](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-service)

Reference Document: [Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-overview/blob/main/guides/VerifiableCredentials.md)

## About this Project

The digital green certificate implements the EU trustframework according the specification of the eHealth Network Interoperability Subgroup (https://github.com/ehn-digital-green-development/hcert-spec). 

To this end the European Commission has tasked Deutsche Telekom and SAP to develop the [Digital Green Certificates Gateway](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway) as well as template applications that may be used by all countries connected to the gateway. These include a national backend with an issuer component ( [Issuance Service](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-issuance-service), [Issuance Web](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-issuance-web) ) and an app to validate Digital Green Certificates ( [Verifier Service](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-service), [Verifier App - Android](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-android), [Verifier App - iOS](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-ios) ) as well as a wallet app to be used by the citizens of connected countries ( [Wallet App - Android](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-wallet-app-android), [Wallet App - iOS](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-wallet-app-ios) ).

Further information can be found at https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/covid-19_en 

**A note on using the apps and released APK files found in this GitHub organization**: The apps are reference implementations that cannot be used in production environments as-is, but rather need to be configured by EU member states to access their national backends. The released APK files are configured to work with the test environments and will not report correct results on "live" DCCs.

## Credits

We'd like to thank all the partners who have been involved in this project from the beginning. Special mention is due to the eHealth Network Interoperability Subgroup that creates the [specification](https://github.com/ehn-digital-green-development/hcert-spec) for this project.
