## About this Project

The digital green certificate implements the EU trustframework according the specification of the eHealth Network Interoperability Subgroup (https://github.com/ehn-digital-green-development/hcert-spec). 

To this end the European Commission has tasked Deutsche Telekom and SAP to develop the [Digital Green Certificates Gateway](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway) as well as applications that may be used by all countries connected to the gateway. These include a national backend with an issuer component ( [Issuance Service](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-issuance-service), [Issuance Web](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-issuance-web) ) and an app to validate Digital Green Certificates ( [Verifier Service](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-service), [Verifier App - Android](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-android), [Verifier App - iOS](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-ios) ) as well as a wallet app to be used by the citizens of connected countries ( [Wallet App - Android](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-wallet-app-android), [Wallet App - iOS](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-wallet-app-ios) ).
